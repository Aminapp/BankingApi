# BankingApi
Project for my Web Services and API module in my 4th year. The Service was developed using Java, Jersey and deployed using Jetty with an SQL database storing the User, Transaction and Account Data. The client was developed in Java and makes calls to every end point within the service and receives responses in JSON format.
